Project Name: ChipChop

Project Team: Madelyn Tavarez, Anthony Fermin, Alvin Kuang

ChipChop is an Android location based services app that allows users to sign up as either 'buyers' or 'vendors' depending on what they would like to use the platform for. The initial goal of this project was to create a space that would facilitate social interaction within communities as well as provide tasty home-cooked meals to those who simply love to eat meals cooked with authenticity! 

The app utilizes technology including Google's maps API, Facebook/Google OAuth login, Services, Broadcasts, Firebase database, and Material Design.
